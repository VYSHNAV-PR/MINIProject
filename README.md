Entertainment industry is growing rapidly and Youtube is considered 
as one of the main entertainment platforms. A huge amount of content 
is uploaded on Youtube by various creators across the globe. The 
success and failure of content in Youtube is determined by amateur 
comments and number of likes. Currently, the contents are not 
influenced by critical reviews and there is no platform for proper rating 
and reviewing of Youtube channels. For a proper rating and reviewing 
of channels, a weighted rating system and a filtered review system 
should be implemented. The proposed platform, uses the mentioned 
system to rate and review channels. This helps the users to review and 
rate the channels critically. The users are able to get genuine 
information about Youtube channels and view their ratings and 
reviews.
